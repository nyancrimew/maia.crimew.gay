earlier this year, [the popular far right fediverse instance poast was hacked](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/leak-poast-kiwi-farms/) leaking user profiles with emails, posts and DMs. today i was sent a special little treat, [a singular html file](/files/posts/meet-the-shitpoasters/meet-the-shitpoasters.html) containing all the poa.st and bae.st profiles with linkedin profiles associated to their e-mail addresses, all their linkedin info, their top 5 worst posts as ranked by sentiment analysis and their DMs. i will leave proper in depth analysis of this data to extremism researchers and journalists, but a few interesting people i can find at a glance are:

- the developer of rtorrent
- at least 4 google employees
- at least 1 amazon employee
- at least 1 microsoft employee
- at least 1 apple employee
- the CISO of tezos foundation
- numerous people in the US military
- ~~a self proclaimed "national socialist" who's a professor at gardner-webb university~~
- just sooo many people in the tech industry

### Correction

after some feedback regarding potential false positives in the list, the source of the compiled document asked me to publish the following correction: "Upon further research, Richard (Shawn) Carmichael aka psychosis67 is not a professor at Gardner-Webb University, but an IT guy from Humboldt, Iowa who impersonated the university professor from North Carolina with the same name on his now deleted LinkedIn profile.". furthermore we found that user bluj162 was also mapped wrong (to the chief operating officer of a school district), research here however shows that bluj162 is the son of J. Sanchez of Palm Beach (who i presume managed his dads LinkedIn?).
